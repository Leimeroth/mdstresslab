This file contains information for installing the OpenKIM API v2.x.x package and
MDStressLab. Since MDStressLab v2.x.x depends on the OpenKIM library v2.x.x, 
the OpenKIM API v2.x.x package should be installed before installing MDStressLab v2.x.x.

The OpenKIM API and OpensKIM Models can be obtained in either binary package form
(for some systems) or for installation from source.

See https://openkim.org/kim-api/#download for details.
