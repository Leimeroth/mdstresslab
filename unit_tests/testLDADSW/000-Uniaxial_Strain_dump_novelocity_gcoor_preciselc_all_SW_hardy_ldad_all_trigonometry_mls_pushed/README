This example is used to study the atomistic stress in a strained cube under
periodic boundary conditions. The cube is stretched in the y-direction with a
strain of 1%. The strain in the x and z directions is equal to zero.

The configuration files dump.initial.0 and dump.final.1 are constructed in LAMMPS, 
which represent the reference and deformed configurations respectively. The dump
files are converted to an MDStressLab configuration file using the utility
dump2str.

To run this example use the command:
1. Generate the MDStressLab configuration file config.data from the LAMMPS configuration
   dump files: 

        ../../bin/dump2str dump.initial.0 dump.final.1 config.data 1 Si

2. Run the example using the command

        ../../bin/mdstresslab.x < testrun.in | tee testrun.out
