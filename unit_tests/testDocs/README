This example is used to study the atomistic stress in a strained cube under
periodic boundary conditions. The cube is stretched in the y-direction with a
strain of 1%. The strain in the x and z directions is equal to zero.

The configuration files dump.initial.0 and dump.final.1 are constructed in LAMMPS, 
which represent the reference and deformed configurations respectively. The dump
files could be converted to an MDStressLab configuration file using the utility
dump2str++.exe (not required).

To run this example use the command:
./testDocs

The *.ref are the expected output file.
